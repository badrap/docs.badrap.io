## Purpose and legal basis for processing

Badrap processes the personal information of its registered users in order to
provide the service to the users. The legal basis for processing is explicit
consent of the data subject - your own consent. You can create an account to the
service yourself and submit your data if you choose to do so. We
always ask for explicit consent before any of your personal data is stored under
your user account.

For users who use our service without creating an user account, the legal
basis for processing personal data is our legitimate interests. 

We use Plausible.io to collect anonymous visitor statistics on our site. 
Plausible.io is a privacy-focused website analytics provider that allows us to 
know someone visited our service. You can review the Plausible.io 
[data policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy) to see how their analytics service

## What personal information do we process?

- One or more email addresses that you may choose to register into our service
- One or more IP addresses that you may choose to register into our service
- Security researchers' warnings regarding your registered IP addresses and email addresses ("assets")

## Data sources

We receive your personal data with your explicit consent when you
create an account for the service and when you use the service. You
can choose to register your assets (IP addresses or email addresses
that you use) under your user account. If you register an asset, it will
be associated with your user account. You can add more assets
under your user account. Registering a new asset under your account always
requires your explicit consent. You can at any time see all of your
personal data under your user account page, remove any registered assets
from your account, or remove your whole user account completely.

We receive information security warnings from security researchers and
research groups who follow malicious Internet traffic. If an asset
that you have registered is found in any security researchers' warning lists,
we will forward you any information regarding your asset that we have
received from security researchers. As a rule, your personal data is not
transferred to security researchers or any other third parties - only you
yourself have access to your own personal data.

## Your rights as a data subject

You have the following rights according to GDPR regarding the processing
of your personal data. You can exercise your rights either directly

information we have stored in our database about you. You can do this
yourself by logging in to your user account and checking your personal
information from your account page.

Right to object: You have the right to object our processing of your personal
data, if you think that our processing does not happen according to the GDPR
or if you think we have no lawful basis for processing your data. You

We process your personal information as long as your user account exists or
as long as you keep using the service. If you have created a user account, you
can at any time delete your account yourself. When you delete your account,
all of your personal information is erased from our systems. If you use the
service without a user account as an anonymous user, you can at any time
just stop using the service and refrain from using it again. This will
cease our processing of your personal data.

## Data recipients

Your personal data can be accessed by named employees of Badrap Ltd,
who develop and maintain the service. As a rule, we do not transfer

subcontractors.

### Data Breach Monitoring

As part of our data breach monitoring service, we offer an integrated
search function against security researcher Troy Hunt's [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
data breach reporting database. This search function allows you to search for
your email addresses from the Have I Been Pwned data breach service, and to be
automatically notified if any new data breaches are published which contain
personal information relating to your email addresses.

Have I Been Pwned [privacy policy](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Privacy) states
they do not store or log your email addresses in any way when a query is
performed. If you do not trust Badrap or Have I Been Pwned for processing
your email addresses securely, you can always refrain from enabling and using
the Have I Been Pwned search feature in Badrap.

Note that you have to always provide your explicit and unambiguous consent to
use Badrap's Have I Been Pwned search feature, and that you can revoke
this consent from your account settings at any time.

### Support Emails

When you choose to contact us by email for general service inquiries,
support requests or any other questions, we use Google Workspace, Microsoft
Office 365 and Hubspot to receive, process and answer your emails. When
you contact us, you consent and acknowledge that we will be processing any
personal data you may include in your email with the aforementioned
third-party services.

### Embedded Content

We may sometimes embed media content such as videos onto our playbooks and
web pages. This embedded media content may reside at an external hosting
provider, such as Youtube. When we embed media content, we do it in a way
that will share as little user information as possible with the content
hosting provider. When viewing embedded content hosted at a third-party
service provider, your viewing and interactions with the content are covered
by the hosting provider's privacy policy. This means that you may have to
review their privacy policy and to provide consent in order to view or
interact with the embedded media. 

## Data transfers outside of EU

Some parts of our technical service implementation use external components:
we use Mailgun for sending automatic email notifications to registered users, 
and Google Cloud SQL for storing information. We require our foreign service 
providers that their countries have an adequate level of data privacy as 
required by the GDPR, and that they are committed to follow the GDPR and 
other relevant EU regulations.

## Automated individual decision-making

Your personal data is NOT used for automated individual decision-making or
profiling.

## Data protection principles and measures

Your personal data is stored and processed according to the best possible
current technical and organizational privacy and security practices that
we know of. We use encryption in all data transfer and storage, access
control and auditing in all access to data, as well as backups and
version control to ensure the integrity and availability of databases and
user account data. We constantly ensure that all our employees are
aware of the importance of data privacy and that everyone works
according to best practices. Our employees are required to uphold
a non-disclosure policy for personal data according to the GDPR. When
a data breach happens, we are prepared to report the incident to the
supervisory authority as well as to the data subjects within the
required time limits specified by legislature. We are also prepared
to present our practices and measures to the supervisory authority, if needed.
We constantly strive to develop our practices and measures further
in order to improve the security and privacy of our service.

Technically the process goes as follows: The user (you) registers
his/her/their email addresses and IP addresses to the service via a
TLS-encrypted session. The data provided by the user is stored into
a Google Cloud SQL database. The database is secured with strong
encryption and it implements SSAE 16, ISO 27001, PCI DSS v3.0 and HIPAA
requirements. Only named Badrap employees who maintain the service
can access the database. All email transmissions are done over
TLS-encrypted connections whenever possible. No physical copies are
ever made of users' personal data and no personal data is ever processed
manually.
