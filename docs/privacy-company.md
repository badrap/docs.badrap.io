We also use HubSpot for sending email to you in few cases: 1) we have identified you might be interested in our
products, 2) you have opted into our newsletter, or 3) your employer has subscribed to our services which require email
communication beyond the communication badrap.io service itself sends. In order to work as efficient content delivery
platforms, they may collect and use information that web browsers expose automatically, such as the browser version, IP
address, site-specific cookies, device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the time of access and user’s
operating system. These services should collect only minimal information required to deliver the content and we don’t
use these services to collect any information for processing. Some of these services may provide you an option to
register directly as their user to improve the user experience. If you have directly registered to any of these services,
we advise you to study their respective privacy policies.

We search for publicly available data to discover leads. We use Linkedin, RocketReach and Alma Talent company search

product inquiries and subscriptions from leads and customers. We use HubSpot, Stripe and DepositFix to record their
contact information. We record the company name and optionally email, your name, VAT number, payment details and phone
number, depending on what information is available or provided. We use this information to contact you if you are
interested in purchasing our services or to provide you the services you have subscribed to. Further contacts are based
on your consent.

### Customer Success and Support Emails

### Embedded Content

We may sometimes embed media content such as videos onto our playbooks and
web pages. This embedded media content may reside at an external hosting
provider, such as Youtube. When we embed media content, we do it in a way
that will share as little user information as possible with the content
hosting provider. When viewing embedded content hosted at a third-party
service provider, your viewing and interactions with the content are
covered by the hosting provider's privacy policy. This means that you
may have to review their privacy policy and to provide consent in order
to view or interact with the embedded media. 

### Playbooks

We use ActiveCampaign for automating playbooks, such as Employee Cyber Hygiene online training and trials. Customers provide their email address or
email addresses for us. Participants may submit further information via forms. Playbook automation requires us to track the progress of the users.
Sometimes we also provide progress statistics to the playbook customers.

## Your rights as a data subject

**Right of access**: You have the right to check at any time, what personal information we have stored about you.

**Right to object**: You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, if you think that our processing does not happen according to the GDPR or if you think we have no lawful basis for processing your data.

**Right to erasure**: You have the right to remove your personal data at any time.

**Right to data portability**: You have the right to request a machine-readable summary of your personal data from us, so that you can transfer them to another service provider.

**Right to lodge a complaint**: You have the right to complain to the supervisory authority if you think we are in violation of your rights, in violation of GDPR, or the Finnish law regarding personal data protection.

**Right to object to direct marketing**: You have the right to object to using your personal data for direct marketing purposes.

## Duration of processing

Email addresses submitted by the users are retained until the user unsubscribes. If a subscriber requests a permanent 
opt-out from any future marketing, then that opt-out address is retained until the person in question requests to be 
removed from the opt-out list.

## Data recipients

Visitor information is processed only by named employees of Badrap Oy, who are responsible for developing and
maintaining the website. Email addresses and subscriptions are processed by our sales and marketing personnel. Currently
we employ no subcontractors or other third parties to process any personal information.

## Data transfers outside of EU

Content delivery services utilize geographically distributed servers in order to deliver the content efficiently, making
it difficult to determine the actual location where short-lived visitor data automatically submitted by the web browsers
is stored.

External services used by us for content delivery and marketing collect and process data outside of the EU.
Where possible we have configured these services to anonymize collected IP addresses. We use only service providers that
comply with an adequate level of data privacy as required by the GDPR and that are committed to following relevant EU
regulations.

## Automated individual decision-making

Your personal data is not used for automated individual decision-making or profiling.

## Data protection principles and measures

We don’t collect or ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. We control and keep track of who has access to the services used to process the data. We use transport layer encryption (TLS) to protect your interaction with our website. We occasionally review the implementation of our website and the related services we rely on against this privacy policy.
