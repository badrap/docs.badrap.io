# Traficom

Traficom app allows you to share your asset information with NCSC-FI (Kyberturvallisuuskeskus), the National Cyber Security Centre of Finland.

Sharing your Badrap asset information with NCSC-FI allows you to receive more accurate incident and vulnerability information about your valuable
online resources.

By installing the app, you agree to share the list of your network assets (IP addresses and domain names) from Badrap to NCSC-FI. When you share the app
installation ID with NCSC-FI, they can tell your assets belong to your organization.

Note that NCSC-FI is responsible for communicating about cyber security incidents and vulnerabilities with companies, organizations and 
individuals within Finland. If you are a Badrap user outside of Finland, you are probably better served by contacting your own local cyber 
security coordination centre.
